    Alexander Kallaway spent a year and a half learning to code and had many ups and downs along the way. He felt his experience
    would be useful to people and so set up #100DaysOfCode, challenging people to code for an hour a day. The challenge now
    has a small army of committed subscribers who share their projects, experiences and progress daily.

    Interested in what life was like when computers were programmed using 4-letter code words and hexadecimal numbers? Well,
    wonder no more. Box-256 is a computer game that challenges you to draw shapes using the kind of limited instruction set
    last seen in the 1960s. Challenging but interesting, even for the most prolific coder.
