            we get people attending who are working their way through resources they've found elsewhere on the web. The following

    Code Combat was designed for use in schools but is a great place to start if you're looking to jump straight in. There are
    about 10 lessons where you get used to the basics but before long you're designing and implementing the AI for a game

    Alexander Kallaway spent a year and a half learning to code and had many ups and downs along the way. He felt his experience
    would be useful to people and so set up #100DaysOfCode, challenging people to code for an hour a day. The challenge now
    has a small army of committed subscribers who share their projects, experiences and progress daily.

  </h5>
  <p>
    In 2015 <a href="http://was.tl/" target="_blank">Eric Wastl</a>, presumably unsatisfied with the singular chocolate found
    behind each door of his Advent calendar, decided to create a series of small programming puzzles instead. It's incredible
    fun to follow, and he has repeated the challenge each year so there are now challenges for  
    <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2015" target="_blank">2015</a>,
    <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016" target="_blank">2016</a> and
    <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2017" target="_blank">2017</a>. The puzzles can be solved in any language and use a
    variety of skills.

    Interested in what life was like when computers were programmed using 4-letter code words and hexadecimal numbers? Well,
    wonder no more. Box-256 is a computer game that challenges you to draw shapes using the kind of limited instruction set
    last seen in the 1960s. Challenging but interesting, even for the most prolific coder.

    with others. The exercises are real code challenges and can be done in any of 20 different languages. Users are encouraged
    to share and discuss their answers, meaning there's always someone to ask and always some way to learn.

    Similar to Advent of Code, this is a resource that presents you with various programming puzzles that can be completed in any
    programming language. Three challenges are put up every week which increase in difficulty, starting with an easy puzzle Monday,
    intermediate puzzle Wednesday and a hard puzzle on a Friday.
