  <p>
    In 2015 <a href="http://was.tl/" target="_blank">Eric Wastl</a>, presumably unsatisfied with the singular chocolate found
    behind each door of his Advent calendar, decided to create a series of small programming puzzles instead. It's incredible
    fun to follow, and he has repeated the challenge each year so there are now challenges for  
    <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2015" target="_blank">2015</a>,
    <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016" target="_blank">2016</a> and
    <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2017" target="_blank">2017</a>. The puzzles can be solved in any language and use a
    variety of skills.

    We think that discussing makes learning better while discussion,we come to know about the point of view of students about the topic.

    Rather than focusing on algorithm we focus on building the basic core concepts of students which will enhance their thinking ability.
