            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <p>
                Set up by Claire Wicher in early 2015, CodeUp is the adult version of Code Club. Initially running out of borrowed office
                space in central Manchester, the aim was to provide free and friendly adult coding tuition to anyone who
                wanted it. Since then it has grown and evolved into a network of spaces from Preston to Stoke-on-Trent,
                Chester to Leeds, where complete beginners and accomplished software engineers (and everyone in between)
                can come together and share their enjoyment of coding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Three years on, the Manchester branch regularly sees between 40-100 people attend each month, some of whom have gone from
                beginner to professional developer in that time. We also have a team of dedicated mentors who attend almost
                every month, all of whom specialise in several languages and technologies.

                CodeUp has always relied on generous companies donating their office space, and in 2016 we were given access to the offices
                of a fantastic digital agency called
                <a href="https://www.codecomputerlove.com/" target="_blank">Code Computerlove</a>. The event runs in the evening so we have
                to use the trade entrance, and this can be a little daunting! Detailed directions and entry instructions can be found
                <a href="directions.html">here</a>.

              <p>
                We usually start the session with the usual pointers about health and safety and facilities, followed by a quick introduction
                of the mentors, a summary of specific problems/questions and a list of any talks or workshops planned for
                that night. Those people who want to do their own thing can find a seat and get going.
              </p>
              <p>
                We encourage people to share and explain their work to anyone interested, so if you see something interesting on someone's
                screen, go up and ask them about it. Similarly, expect a tap on the shoulder if you're working on something
                exciting.

                Not really. Recruitment consultants who actively target people at CodeUp will be politely asked not to, but apart from that
                we'd just ask that you're respectful, look after the location and be mindful of other people and their property.

                All you have to do is turn up. People typically start arriving at 6:45pm and most people are in by 7pm, but if you can't
                quite make those then just turn up a bit later.
              </p>

                We would recommend that you bring a laptop, a notepad and a pen, but the rest is up to you. Let us know you're coming by
                RSVPing to the event on our
                <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CodeUpManchester/" target="_blank">Meetup page</a> or join our

                and chat to people there. Feel free to ask questions and share ideas for things to do.

              <h2>Can I be a mentor?</h2>
              <p>
                Definitely! You can RSVP on
                <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CodeUpManchester/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>, but there's no need to do anything specific as a mentor. At the start of the event there is
                often a quick matching up of people who are looking for help with a particular language, or you can just
                wander round and see who needs a hand.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you've been a few times and feel like you're becoming part of the furniture, you can submit a picture of yourself and
                a bit of blurb to Drew to go on the
                <a href="people.html" target="_blank">people</a> page. However, if you're super-duper keen to score bonus respect and kudos, branch off from
                master on the CodeUpManchester repository with the same name as this domain, add yourself to the people
                page and put in a pull request. ;)
