                Three years on, the Manchester branch regularly sees between 40-100 people attend each month, some of whom have gone from
                beginner to professional developer in that time. We also have a team of dedicated mentors who attend almost
                every month, all of whom specialise in several languages and technologies.

                We usually start the session with weak subject of student and prepare him/her with better example and build strong concept.

              <p>
                We encourage student to share and tell in which subject or topic they feel weak on which I will try to help them to build strong concepts.

                CodeUp sessions are inclusive, friendly and provide safe environments, and all organisers and mentors are asked to comply with
                the <a href="http://codeup.wikia.com/wiki/CodeUp_Code_of_Conduct" target="_blank">CodeUp Code of Conduct (CoC)</a> when they 
                apply to help out. As such, we expect attendees to show the same level of respect for other people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please also note that whilst recruitment consultants are welcome to attend to learn more about programming and code in general,
                those who actively target people at CodeUp in an attempt to recruit them will be politely asked not to and, if they persist,
                will be asked to leave.
              </p>
              <p>
                In general, we just ask that you're respectful, look after the location and be mindful of other people and their property.

                All you have to do is turn up. People typically start arriving at 6:45pm and most people are in by 7pm, but if you can't
                quite make those then just turn up a bit later.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would recommend that you bring a laptop, a notepad and a pen, but the rest is up to you. Let us know you're coming by
                RSVPing to the event on our

              <h2>Can I be a mentor?</h2>
              <p>
                Definitely! If you're interested in helping out just send the host (usually 
                <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CodeUpManchester/members/190004913/" target="_blank">Drew</a>) a message on 
                <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CodeUpManchester/" target="_blank">Meetup</a> and let them know a bit about you.
                We like to know:
                <ul>
                    <li>your name</li>
                    <li>your background</li>
                    <li>your daily occupation or experience level</li>
                    <li>whether or not you've been to CodeUp before</li>
                    <li>any previous mentoring experience</li>
                    <li>why you want to mentor</li>
                    <li>when you'd like to start</li>
                </ul>
                As mentioned above, we'll ask you to send us an email saying you accept and will comply with
                the <a href="http://codeup.wikia.com/wiki/CodeUp_Code_of_Conduct" target="_blank">CodeUp Code of Conduct (CoC)</a>.
                There's no specific job as a mentor and we don't expect you to attend every single session.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the start of the event there's often a quick matching-up of people who are looking for help with a particular language 
                or problem, so you can offer help then or you can just wander round and see who needs a hand. If you want to do something
                bigger, like set up a project/workshop or do a talk, then just let us know beforehand and we'll help you arrange it.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you've been a few times and feel like you're becoming part of the furniture, you can submit a picture of yourself and
                a bit of blurb for the <a href="people.html" target="_blank">people</a> page. The best way to do it is through GitHub; 
                just branch off from master on the
                <a href="https://github.com/CodeUpManchester/codeupmanchester.github.io" target="_blank">web site repository</a>,
                add yourself to the people page and put in a pull request. ;)
