              <p>He also enjoys networking, finding out about new things, and helping people, which is why he's always creating useful websites like <a href="http://mcrmeetup.tech/" target="_blank">Manchester Tech Meetups</a> (to help find networking events after, attending a few hundred himself), but also takes part in many Hackathons and volunteers whenever possible.</p>
